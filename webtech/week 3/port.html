    <p>From my childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology. Throughout my life, I have been driven by the desire to “create”. I chose the computer science field to feed my curiosity, but once I started understanding things. When I was in high school, the building mechanisms of software caught my attention. I was surprised that even games which I used to play were programmed and we could program a lot more interesting stuff. That’s when I realized that computer science was going to be my favorite subject. I remember the first time seeing code, the technological advancement in the last decade has inspired me to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in computer science. I feel artificial intelligence is the future. This degree will help me to become more innovative, creative, and problem-solving.
        Moving on to academics, I completed the secondary education examination (SEE) from Dreamland public high school with a GPA (of 3.90) after completing SEE I joined Kathmandu institute of science and technology college(Kist college) and got a GPA(of 2.97). 
        Intrigued by the good career prospect, and opportunities, to work across the world. Studying computer science at a higher level will provide both practical and theoretical knowledge that will be useful in real life.
        After completing high school, I was confused about where to pursue my further study. After visiting various colleges, Herald College is affiliated with the University of Wolverhampton. I was attracted to infrastructure and affordability. This college is focused on practicality more than theoretical knowledge. After the completion, of course, Herald College will also provide an international degree.
        As I want to become a software engineer/AI engineer, this degree will help me get resources related to this field. The connection that I will make during the course will help to land a job in the tech field. A computer science degree will enhance my critical thinking, problem-solving, and programming skill which will be useful in real life.</p>
